# Writing Computer Applications

In this project I compile a collection of thoughts and examples
covering how to build computer applications from the ground up.
Specifically, the project discusses basic x86 and ARM assembly
language, operating system calls, networking, C, and basic
graphics. The hope is to provide a guide for building fully
functional applications while maintaining some
understanding of what is happening on the hardware level.

The main inspiration for this project came after teaching a course on
assembly language programming at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Thinking about low level programming and operating systems drew me
back to the joy of working closely with hardware and designing
programs that I could feasibly reason about. This revelation happened
to correspond with a time that I was employed working on
a horribly slow and complex JavaScript codebase.

I try my best to make examples cross platform with Windows
where I can, but I primarily work with Linux systems and Linux/POSIX
is what the project focuses on.
